    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
    #               your learned logistic regression parameters (one-vs-all).
    #               You should set p to a vector of predictions (from 1 to
    #               num_labels).
    #
    # Hint: This code can be done all vectorized using the max function.
    #       In particular, the max function can also return the index of the 
    #       max element, for more information see 'help max'. If your examples 
    #       are in rows, then, you can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max 
    #       for each row.
    #       
    
    #all_theta 는 (class 수 * n+1) 이므로 traspose 해야한다.
    
    p = np.argmax(sigmoid(X @ all_theta.T), axis=1) + 1 #index 가 0부터 시작하므로 +1로 보정
    #예측한 값들 중에서 최대값의 index(label)을 선택.
        
    return p
