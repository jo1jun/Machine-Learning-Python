## Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 4 Neural Network Learning

#  Instructions
#  ------------
# 
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
#  in this exericse:
#
#     sigmoidGradient.m
#     randInitializeWeights.m
#     nnCostFunction.m
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
#

## Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400  # 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25   # 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10          # 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                         # (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

## =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
#

# Load Training Data
print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

mat = scipy.io.loadmat('ex4data1.mat')
X, y = mat['X'], mat['y']
#print(X.shape)
#print(y.shape)

print("'y' shape: ", mat['y'].shape, "Unique elements in y: " ,np.unique(mat['y']))
print("'X' shape: ",X.shape,"X[0] shape: ",X[0].shape)

m = X.shape[0]

# Randomly select 100 data points to display
rand_indices = np.random.choice(m,100,replace=False)    #비복원 추출
sel = X[rand_indices, :]

displayData(sel)

## ================ Part 2: Loading Parameters ================
# In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
# neural network parameters.

print('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

# Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
mat_Theta = scipy.io.loadmat('ex4weights.mat')

Theta1 = mat_Theta['Theta1']
Theta2 = mat_Theta['Theta2']

print('Theta1.shape : ', Theta1.shape)
print('Theta2.shape : ', Theta2.shape)

# Unroll parameters
nn_params = np.append(Theta1.reshape(-1), Theta2.reshape(-1))   # -1 : 나머지 원소들로 알아서.
#print(nn_params.shape)

## ================ Part 3: Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
#  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
#  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
#  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
#  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
#  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
#  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
#
#  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
#  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
#  will get to implement the regularized cost.
#
print('\nFeedforward Using Neural Network ...\n')

# Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 0 here).
_lambda = 0

J,_ = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, _lambda)

print('Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): %f\n(this value should be about 0.287629)\n' %J)

## =============== Part 4: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your cost function implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost.
#

print('\nChecking Cost Function (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

# Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 1 here).
_lambda = 1

J,_ = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, _lambda)

print('Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): %f\n(this value should be about 0.383770)\n'% J)


## ================ Part 5: Sigmoid Gradient  ================
#  Before you start implementing the neural network, you will first
#  implement the gradient for the sigmoid function. You should complete the
#  code in the sigmoidGradient.m file.
#

print('\nEvaluating sigmoid gradient...\n')

g = sigmoidGradient([-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1])
print('Sigmoid gradient evaluated at [-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1]:\n  ')
print(g)
print('\n\n')


## ================ Part 6: Initializing Pameters ================
#  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implment a two
#  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
#  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
#  (randInitializeWeights.m)

print('\nInitializing Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size)
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights(hidden_layer_size, num_labels)

# Unroll parameters
initial_nn_params = np.append(initial_Theta1.reshape(-1), initial_Theta2.reshape(-1))


## =============== Part 7: Implement Backpropagation ===============
#  Once your cost matches up with ours, you should proceed to implement the
#  backpropagation algorithm for the neural network. You should add to the
#  code you've written in nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
#  derivatives of the parameters.
#
print('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
_lambda = 0
checkNNGradients(_lambda)

## =============== Part 8: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost and gradient.
#

print('\nChecking Backpropagation (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
_lambda = 3
checkNNGradients(_lambda)

# Also output the costFunction debugging values
debug_J,_  = nnCostFunction(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, _lambda)

print('\n\nCost at (fixed) debugging parameters (w/ lambda = ',_lambda,'): ',debug_J,' '\
         '\n(for lambda = 3, this value should be about 0.576051)\n\n')


## =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
#  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
#  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
#  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
#  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
#  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
#
print('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')

#  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
#  value to see how more training helps.
#  options = optimset('MaxIter', 50)

#  You should also try different values of lambda
_lambda = 1

# Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = lambda p: nnCostFunction(p, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, _lambda)

# Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
# neural network parameters)
result = op.minimize(fun=costFunction,x0=initial_nn_params,method='L-BFGS-B',jac=True,options={'maxiter':50})

# Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
Theta1 = result.x[:(input_layer_size + 1) * hidden_layer_size] #bias 고려하여 +1
Theta2 = result.x[np.size(Theta1):]
Theta1 = Theta1.reshape(hidden_layer_size, -1)
Theta2 = Theta2.reshape(num_labels, -1)

## ================= Part 9: Visualize Weights =================
#  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by 
#  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in 
#  the data.

print('\nVisualizing Neural Network... \n')

displayData(Theta1[:,1:])

## ================= Part 10: Implement Predict =================
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)
pred = pred.reshape(-1,1)

print('\nTraining Set Accuracy: ', np.mean((pred == y)) * 100, '\n')
