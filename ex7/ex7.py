## Machine Learning Online Class
#  Exercise 7 | Principle Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering
#
#  Instructions
#  ------------
#
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
#
#     pca.m
#     projectData.m
#     recoverData.m
#     computeCentroids.m
#     findClosestCentroids.m
#     kMeansInitCentroids.m
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
#

## ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
#  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
#  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
#  part, you should complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 
#
print('Finding closest centroids.\n\n')

# Load an example dataset that we will be using
mat = scipy.io.loadmat('ex7data2.mat')
X = mat['X']

# Select an initial set of centroids
K = 3 # 3 Centroids
initial_centroids = np.array([[3, 3], [6, 2], [8, 5]])

# Find the closest centroids for the examples using the
# initial_centroids
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, initial_centroids)

print('Closest centroids for the first 3 examples: \n')
print(idx[:3] + 1) # python 은 index 0 부터 시작.
print('\n(the closest centroids should be 1, 3, 2 respectively)\n')

## ===================== Part 2: Compute Means =========================
#  After implementing the closest centroids function, you should now
#  complete the computeCentroids function.
#
print('\nComputing centroids means.\n\n')

#  Compute means based on the closest centroids found in the previous part.
centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)

print('Centroids computed after initial finding of closest centroids: \n')
print(centroids)
print('\n(the centroids should be\n')
print('   [ 2.428301 3.157924 ]\n')
print('   [ 5.813503 2.633656 ]\n')
print('   [ 7.119387 3.616684 ]\n\n')

## =================== Part 3: K-Means Clustering ======================
#  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
#  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
#  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
#  the example dataset we have provided. 
#
print('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n')

# Load an example dataset
mat = scipy.io.loadmat('ex7data2.mat')
X = mat['X']

# Settings for running K-Means
K = 3
max_iters = 10

# For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
# but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
# settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
# kMeansInitCentroids).
initial_centroids = np.array([[3, 3], [6, 2], [8, 5]])

# Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
# the progress of K-Means
centroids, idx = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, True)
print('\nK-Means Done.\n\n')

## ============= Part 4: K-Means Clustering on Pixels ===============
#  In this exercise, you will use K-Means to compress an image. To do this,
#  you will first run K-Means on the colors of the pixels in the image and
#  then you will map each pixel onto its closest centroid.
#  
#  You should now complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m
#

print('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n')

# Load an image of a bird
# reference : https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userapi.html
A = imageio.imread('bird_small.png')


# If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
# mat =  scipy.io.loadmat('bird_small.mat')
# A = mat['A']

A = A / 255 # Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1

# Size of the image
img_size = np.shape(A)

# Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
# Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
# This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
X = np.reshape(A, (img_size[0] * img_size[1], 3))

# Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
# You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 16 
max_iters = 10

# When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
# randomly. 
# You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)

# Run K-Means
centroids, idx = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters)

## ================= Part 5: Image Compression ======================
#  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
#  compress an image. To do this, we first find the closest clusters for
#  each example. After that, we 

print('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n')

# Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)

# Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
# indices in idx. 

# We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
# (specified by its index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids[idx,:]

# Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = X_recovered.reshape(img_size[0], img_size[1], 3)

plt.figure()
# Display the original image 
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(A)
plt.title('Original')

# Display compressed image side by side
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(X_recovered)
plt.title('Compressed, with {} colors.'.format(K))

## ================= Part 6: Use your own image ======================

print('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n')
A = imageio.imread('my_image.png')

# If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
# mat =  scipy.io.loadmat('bird_small.mat')
# A = mat['A']

A = A / 255 # Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1

# Size of the image
img_size = np.shape(A)

# Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
# Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
# This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
X = np.reshape(A, (img_size[0] * img_size[1], 3))

# Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
# You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 16
max_iters = 10

# When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
# randomly. 
# You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)

# Run K-Means
centroids, idx = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters)

## ================= Part 5: Image Compression ======================
#  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
#  compress an image. To do this, we first find the closest clusters for
#  each example. After that, we 

print('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n')

# Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)

# Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
# indices in idx. 

# We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
# (specified by its index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids[idx,:]

# Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = X_recovered.reshape(img_size[0], img_size[1], 3)

plt.figure()
# Display the original image 
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(A)
plt.title('Original')

# Display compressed image side by side
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(X_recovered)
plt.title('Compressed, with {} colors.'.format(K))

imageio.imwrite('compressed_my_image.png', X_recovered.astype(np.uint8))
